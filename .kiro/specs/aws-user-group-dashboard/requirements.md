# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AWS User Group Dashboard is a serverless web application that provides real-time analytics and insights for AWS user groups worldwide. The application integrates with the Meetup.com GraphQL API to fetch live data about user groups, displaying comprehensive analytics including member counts, event statistics, and detailed group information through an interactive, responsive web interface deployed on AWS infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a community manager, I want to view real-time analytics of AWS user groups across different countries, so that I can understand the global reach and engagement of the AWS community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the "Load Data" button THEN the system SHALL fetch and display total countries, total groups, and total members from the Meetup API
2. WHEN the data is successfully retrieved THEN the system SHALL display the analytics in a visually appealing card format with proper number formatting
3. WHEN the API call fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user
4. WHEN credentials are not configured THEN the system SHALL return mock data with a notification that real credentials are needed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a community organizer, I want to see a comprehensive list of all AWS user groups with their key statistics, so that I can compare group performance and identify successful communities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analytics data is loaded THEN the system SHALL display a table of all user groups with name, country, founded date, member count, events in last 12 months, and average RSVPs
2. WHEN displaying member counts THEN the system SHALL format numbers with proper locale formatting (e.g., 1,500 instead of 1500)
3. WHEN displaying dates THEN the system SHALL format founded dates in a readable format (MM/DD/YYYY)
4. WHEN no groups are available THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message indicating no groups found

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user group leader, I want to view detailed information about specific groups including their past events, so that I can learn from successful groups and understand event patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a group row THEN the system SHALL expand to show detailed group information
2. WHEN group details are expanded THEN the system SHALL fetch and display the group's past events with titles, dates, and RSVP counts
3. WHEN fetching group details THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator while the API call is in progress
4. WHEN group details fail to load THEN the system SHALL display an error message specific to that group
5. WHEN a user clicks on an expanded group row THEN the system SHALL collapse the details section

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the dashboard to work seamlessly on my smartphone and tablet, so that I can access community data while on the go.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a responsive layout optimized for small screens
2. WHEN viewing on tablets THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout for medium-sized screens
3. WHEN interacting with expandable elements on touch devices THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate touch targets and feedback
4. WHEN viewing tables on mobile THEN the system SHALL maintain readability with appropriate font sizes and spacing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to be deployed on AWS infrastructure with proper security and performance optimizations, so that it can handle traffic efficiently and securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL use AWS CDK for infrastructure as code
2. WHEN serving static content THEN the system SHALL use CloudFront CDN for global distribution and caching
3. WHEN storing static files THEN the system SHALL use S3 with appropriate bucket policies and public access configuration
4. WHEN handling API requests THEN the system SHALL use API Gateway with proper CORS configuration
5. WHEN executing backend logic THEN the system SHALL use Lambda functions with appropriate timeout and memory settings
6. WHEN storing sensitive credentials THEN the system SHALL use AWS Secrets Manager with proper IAM permissions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to integrate securely with the Meetup.com API, so that real-time data can be fetched without exposing credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls to Meetup THEN the system SHALL use OAuth2 access tokens stored in AWS Secrets Manager
2. WHEN credentials are missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to mock data
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error messages and return user-friendly error responses
4. WHEN handling GraphQL queries THEN the system SHALL construct proper queries for analytics, group lists, and event details
5. WHEN processing API responses THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting and network errors appropriately

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the application to provide clear feedback during loading states and handle errors gracefully, so that I understand what's happening and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initiating data fetching THEN the system SHALL disable the fetch button and show loading text
2. WHEN API calls are in progress THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading indicators
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with sufficient detail for troubleshooting
4. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL restore interactive elements to their normal state
5. WHEN displaying error states THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling and clear messaging

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the application to follow AWS design guidelines and accessibility standards, so that it provides a professional appearance and is usable by people with disabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria
