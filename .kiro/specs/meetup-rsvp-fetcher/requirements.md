# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a Python application that interfaces with the Meetup.com GraphQL API to fetch and list events along with their RSVP data across all events in a MeetupPro network. The application will handle authentication, make GraphQL queries, and present the data in a structured format for analysis and reporting purposes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a MeetupPro network administrator, I want to authenticate with the Meetup API, so that I can access event and RSVP data for my network.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL prompt for or load Meetup API credentials
2. WHEN valid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL successfully authenticate with the Meetup GraphQL API
3. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and exit gracefully
4. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL store the authentication token for subsequent API calls

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a MeetupPro network administrator, I want to fetch all events from my network, so that I can get a comprehensive view of network activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authenticated THEN the system SHALL query the GraphQL API to retrieve all events in the MeetupPro network
2. WHEN fetching events THEN the system SHALL handle pagination to ensure all events are retrieved
3. IF the API returns an error THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing other events where possible
4. WHEN events are retrieved THEN the system SHALL extract essential event information including event ID, title, date, and group information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a MeetupPro network administrator, I want to fetch RSVP data for each event, so that I can analyze attendance patterns and engagement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN event data is available THEN the system SHALL query the GraphQL API for RSVP information for each event
2. WHEN fetching RSVPs THEN the system SHALL retrieve RSVP status, member information, and response timestamps
3. WHEN processing RSVPs THEN the system SHALL handle different RSVP statuses (yes, no, waitlist)
4. IF RSVP data is unavailable for an event THEN the system SHALL log this and continue processing other events

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a MeetupPro network administrator, I want the data presented in a structured format, so that I can easily analyze and export the information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all data is collected THEN the system SHALL format the output in a readable structure showing events and their RSVPs
2. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL include event details, RSVP counts, and member information
3. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide summary statistics including total events and total RSVPs
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL include error reporting in the output without stopping the entire process

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the code to be maintainable and configurable, so that it can be easily modified and deployed in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is structured THEN the system SHALL separate concerns with distinct modules for authentication, API calls, and data processing
2. WHEN configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL support environment variables or configuration files for API credentials and settings
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and logging throughout the application
4. WHEN the code is written THEN the system SHALL include appropriate documentation and type hints for maintainability
