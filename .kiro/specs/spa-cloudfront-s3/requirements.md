# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a simple single page web application (SPA) that will be deployed using AWS CloudFront and S3. The application will include a sample landing page with example graphs and will be provisioned using AWS CDK in Python. The infrastructure will be deployed using the sandpit-1-admin AWS profile for simplicity and ease of development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create AWS infrastructure using CDK in Python, so that I can deploy a static website with proper cloud distribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CDK stack is synthesized THEN the system SHALL generate CloudFormation templates for S3 and CloudFront resources
2. WHEN the CDK stack is deployed THEN the system SHALL create an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting
3. WHEN the CDK stack is deployed THEN the system SHALL create a CloudFront distribution pointing to the S3 bucket
4. WHEN deploying the infrastructure THEN the system SHALL use the sandpit-1-admin AWS profile from ~/.aws/config

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access a landing page with sample graphs, so that I can see a functional web application with visual data representation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the CloudFront URL THEN the system SHALL serve a landing page with HTML content
2. WHEN the landing page loads THEN the system SHALL display at least 2-3 example graphs or charts
3. WHEN the page is accessed THEN the system SHALL load quickly through CloudFront's CDN
4. WHEN viewing the graphs THEN the system SHALL use a simple charting library (like Chart.js) for visualization

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simple and maintainable infrastructure code, so that I can easily understand and modify the deployment without complex patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the CDK code THEN the system SHALL use straightforward CDK constructs without complex abstractions
2. WHEN examining the project structure THEN the system SHALL have a clear and minimal file organization
3. WHEN reading the infrastructure code THEN the system SHALL avoid unnecessary design patterns or over-engineering
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL require minimal configuration beyond the AWS profile

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the S3 bucket to be properly configured for web hosting, so that static files are served correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the S3 bucket is created THEN the system SHALL enable static website hosting
2. WHEN configuring the bucket THEN the system SHALL set index.html as the default document
3. WHEN setting up permissions THEN the system SHALL allow CloudFront to access the bucket contents
4. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL serve them with appropriate content types

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast global access to the website, so that the application loads quickly regardless of my location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CloudFront is configured THEN the system SHALL cache static assets at edge locations
2. WHEN a user requests content THEN the system SHALL serve it from the nearest CloudFront edge location
3. WHEN setting up caching THEN the system SHALL use appropriate cache behaviors for HTML, CSS, and JS files
4. WHEN the distribution is created THEN the system SHALL provide a CloudFront domain name for access
